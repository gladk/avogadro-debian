testfiles/*:

  Some files in the testfiles directory include license and use restriction
  hints and copyright notices of some commercial and non-disclosure software.
  To our understanding (see http://bugs.debian.org/643921) these texts refer
  to the non-free software programs (like Gaussian) that produced this output
  but not to the file format nor any output file.
